a program that will perform semantic indexing (or annotation) of the
emotions of tweets. In other words, that mean program will : -
associate semantic tags (identified by their IRI) to the tweet
representing the detected emotions. You can use the following tools: -
the TreeTagger tool for morphosyntactic analysis of texts; source:
https://cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/ - the Python
treetaggerwrapper library, which connects Python to TreeTagger;
source: https://pypi.org/project/treetaggerwrapper/ - the Python twint
library, which scrapes tweets; source:
https://pypi. org/project/twint/ - the French lexicon of emotions;
source: http://advanse.lirmm.fr/feel.php - the ontology of emotions;
source: http ://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mfoem.owl - the Python
Owlready library, allowing to manipulate ontologies in owl
format. source: https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/
